This application is a partner management system. Basically, the Comarev admins register the interested companies that want to give a discount on their products/services to the Comarev contributors who are also registered in the system. Then, when the contributor buys something at the company (Comarev partner), they just have to scan a QR Code emitted in our dashboard and the system will return if they are ok with the payment (contribution), or not. If so, the contributor can get a discount.

Please check the [WHO_WE_ARE](WHO_WE_ARE.md) section for more information.

## Roadmap

Check [our board](https://github.com/comarev/comarev-dashboard/projects/2) for more details about what we're building.

- [x] Comarev dashboard MVP

The core of this system is ready and running on production. But there are lot of improvements we can do and we need your help!

## Development

### Getting started

First of all, make sure you have your [backend](https://github.com/comarev/comarev) running.

Clone the project from Github:

```
git@github.com:comarev/comarev-dashboard.git
cd comarev-dashboard
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Create a **.env** file by copying the existing one:

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

Set the value of `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` pointing to your backend address and then run:

```
yarn start

```
After application boot, you will see the login screen
and you can sign in using one of the credentials below:

```
  email: admin@example.com
  password: 123456

  email: manager@example.com
  password: 123456

  email: regular@example.com
  password: 123456

```

### E2E Tests

Make sure you have your frontend running.

Set the value of `baseUrl` on `cypress.json` pointing to your frontend address and then run:

```
yarn test:e2e
```

## Application Concepts

### Users

A user can be an `admin`, `manager`, `employee` or a `customer`.

- Admins are the Comarev employees and can control the entire system. They are able to create the other kind of users. To become an admin, the user need the `admin` attribute `true`.
- Managers are the company managers. They can emmit their QR Code and also check if a user is able to get discount. To become a manager, the user needs to be assigned to a company.
- Employees do the same as managers, but they can't invite other employees or manage the company config.
- Customers are the Comarev contributors. They are supposed to pay invoices and get discounts. If the user is neither an admin nor a manager, he's a customer.

### Companies

A company is a comarev partner. They offer discounts to the Comarev contributors.

### Invoices

A invoice is created for a user. When all invoices are paid, the user is able to get a discount. Invoices can only be created and mark as paid by an admin user, but customers can visualize them.
